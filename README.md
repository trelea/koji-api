## Technical Excellence

KOJI is built with performance and scalability as core principles. The application employs a microservices-ready architecture that can be deployed as a monolith for smaller implementations or expanded into distributed services for enterprise-scale deployments. The codebase follows SOLID principles and clean architecture patterns, making it maintainable and extensible.

The database layer utilizes PostgreSQL's advanced features including materialized views for complex reporting, JSON capabilities for flexible data structures, and sophisticated indexing strategies for optimal query performance. Redis provides not only caching but also pub/sub capabilities for real-time event propagation throughout the system.

Security is baked into every layer with comprehensive input validation, output sanitization, rate limiting, and continuous vulnerability scanning integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.

## Getting Started

KOJI requires Node.js and uses Yarn as its package manager. To begin your journey:

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Configure your environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Run in development mode
yarn start:dev

# Build for production
yarn build
yarn start:prod
```

## Environment Configuration

Configure your installation using the following environment variables:

```
DB_HOST=<str>              # PostgreSQL host address
DB_USER=<str>              # Database username
DB_PASS=<str>              # Database password
DB_NAME=<str>              # Database name
DB_PORT=<nr>               # Database port number

# JWT Configuration
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=<str>    # Secret for signing access tokens
JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRATION=<nr> # Access token lifetime in minutes
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<str>   # Secret for signing refresh tokens
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRATION=<nr> # Refresh token lifetime in minutes
JWT_OTP_SECRET=<str>       # Secret for signing OTP tokens
JWT_OTP_EXPIRATION=<nr>    # OTP token lifetime in minutes

# Redis Configuration
REDIS_HOST=<str>           # Redis host address
REDIS_USER=<str>           # Redis username for ACL
REDIS_PASS=<str>           # Redis password
REDIS_PORT=<nr>            # Redis port number

# Encryption Settings
CRYPTO_SALT=<str>          # Salt for cryptographic operations
CRYPTO_KEY_LEN=<nr>        # Key length for encryption algorithms

# Application Settings
ORIGIN=<str>               # CORS origin setting
RESEND_API_KEY=<str>       # API key for email services

# Rate Limiting
THROTTLE_TTL=<nr>          # Rate limit window in minutes
THROTTLE_LIMIT=<nr>        # Maximum requests within window

# AWS S3 Configuration
AWS_S3_ACCESS=<str>        # AWS access key ID
AWS_S3_SECRET=<str>        # AWS secret access key
AWS_S3_REGION=<str>        # AWS region
AWS_S3_BUCKET=<str>        # S3 bucket name
```

## Redis Configuration

KOJI uses Redis with Access Control Lists (ACL) for enhanced security. Configure your Redis instance with the following ACL settings in `redis.conf`:

```
# Enable ACL with two users
# Default user (disabled if not needed)
user default off

# Custom app user
user <USER> on ><PASSWORD> allkeys allcommands
```

Replace `<USER>` and `<PASSWORD>` with the same credentials specified in your `.env` file. This configuration ensures that only authenticated users can access your Redis instance.
